Another type of reference error can occur with variables instead of functions. For example, the `ReferenceError` can be thrown when the interpreter can't find a declared variable that's being called in a program. Very often, this error will be the result of a typo. Try running the following code with `mocha spec.js`:

```
ReferenceError: firs is not defined
```

The error is telling us that it couldn't find a variable named "firs". This is because the variable we declared in the argument list is named "first". Correct the typo and the function should pass the specs.
