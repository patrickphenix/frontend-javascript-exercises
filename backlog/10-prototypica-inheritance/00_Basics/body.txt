Create a `Book` class with two methods. The `title_and_author` method should take two arguments so that it can set `title` and `author` attributes. This method should simply take arguments and set them to an instance variables. There is no test spec for this method, its implementation will be tested in the `description` method (below).

The `description` method should return a string with both instance variables. The string returned should be formatted as:

"Title was written by author"

> Remember that the words "title" and "author" will be replaced by instance variables declared in the `title_and_author` method.
